  <h2> Description </h2>
  <p>
    I need to associate this data with a room. <br />
    I need to extract a timestamp.<br />
    Parse the data given by the Raspberry to have a similar structure to that of the phone.<br />
    The Raspberry is supposed to measure at the same time as the phone. So maybe it makes sense to not assume that rooms
    pre-exist. For this reason I have added an input field.
